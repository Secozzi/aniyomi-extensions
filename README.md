# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Aniyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/Secozzi/aniyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).

# Requests

I unfortunately do not take requests, as this repo is only for extensions I use myself.
